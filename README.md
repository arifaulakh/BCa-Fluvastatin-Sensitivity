# BCa-Fluvastatin-Sensitivity
 
This repository houses the code and results for the research project entitled "Repurposing Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs to Personalize Breast Cancer Treatment".

I worked on this project during the 2018-2019 academic year with student Richard Cheng, with the supervision and mentorship of Mr. Petr Smirnov, Mr. Joseph Longo and Dr. Linda Penn, in the Penn and Benjamin Haibe-Kains labs at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.

Our project examined using fluvastatin, a member of a family of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, as a possible treatment for Breast cancer. In particular, we used bioinformatics methods in R (with packages such as PharmacoGx) on existing datasets along with wet-lab experiments to conduct our project.
